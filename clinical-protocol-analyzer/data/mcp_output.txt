Nct Number: NCT06513949
Study Title: Anti-CD14 Treatment With IC14 in Hospitalized ARDS Patients
Study Url: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06513949
Study Status: NOT_YET_RECRUITING
Brief Summary:
  Hospitalized patients with ARDS will be randomized to intravenous
  treatment with a monoclonal antibody against CD14, called IC14, or
  placebo. They will be followed for 28 days.

  The primary outcome is the day 4 oxygenation index assessed as a
  continuous measure.
